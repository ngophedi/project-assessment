##This script sets up a multi-threaded TCP server that listens for connections, 
receives string queries, and checks if the query string exists in a specified file.

##The server can be configured to re-read the file on every query or load it once into memory.

##It supports SSL for secure communication, depending on the configuration settings.

##The server logs each query, along with the time taken to process it.



##Run the server using 

python3 server.py

##Run the client using on another terminal 

python3 client.py

##Enter the string you want to search for when prompted.
